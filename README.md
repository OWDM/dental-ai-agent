---

## ✅ Phase 1, 2, 3 & 5: COMPLETED

### What's Built

**Router + FAQ + Booking + Management Agents**
- ✅ **Router** - LLM-based intent classification with conversation memory
- ✅ **FAQ Agent** - RAG-powered Q&A (ChromaDB + Jina embeddings)
  - Real-time date awareness (answers "Is the clinic open tomorrow?" correctly)
- ✅ **Booking Agent** - Google Calendar integration with conflict detection + email notifications
  - Check patient appointments
  - Show available doctors & services from database
  - Create bookings with duplicate prevention
  - Detects both doctor and patient time conflicts
  - **Prevents booking in the past** (real-time date/time awareness)
  - Sends confirmation emails automatically
- ✅ **Management Agent** - Appointment management with natural language + email notifications
  - View all upcoming appointments
  - Cancel appointments (by doctor name, service, or date)
  - Reschedule appointments with conflict detection
  - **Prevents rescheduling to past dates** (real-time date/time awareness)
  - No IDs needed - uses natural references like "my appointment with Dr. Saad"
  - Sends cancellation/reschedule confirmation emails automatically
- ✅ **Escalation Agent** - Human handoff for emergencies and hostility
  - Parallel execution with intent classification (Zero Latency)
  - Detects hostility, threats, and medical emergencies
  - Handles "Talk to human" requests
- ✅ Patient selection at startup (knows who you are throughout conversation)
- ✅ **TRT Architecture** (Translate-Reason-Translate) - Bilingual support
  - Auto-detects Arabic/English input
  - Translates Arabic → English for processing
  - Translates response back to Arabic
  - Uses Cohere model via OpenRouter for translations
  - Maintains dental terminology glossary for accurate translations
- ✅ **Auto-Ticket Creation** - Post-conversation analysis and database archiving
  - LLM-powered conversation summarization
  - Automatic ticket categorization
  - Self-correcting validation for database constraints
  - Proper timestamps: `created_at` (conversation start), `updated_at` (conversation end), `resolved_at` (only when resolved)
  - Saves to Supabase on exit (quit or Ctrl+C)

### Database Schema (Supabase)

**Existing Data:**
- 8 patients (already in database - NO creation needed)
- 5 doctors
- 10 services
- Appointments stored in Google Calendar only

**Tables:**
- `patients` - id, name, email, phone
- `doctors` - id, name, specialization, google_calendar_id, available
- `services` - id, name, description, duration_minutes, price
- `support_tickets` - conversation tracking

## 📊 Architecture

### Hierarchical Multi-Agent System

```
User Input (Arabic/English)
    ↓
[TRT Pre-Processing]
 └─> Detect language → Translate to English (if Arabic)
    ↓
[Parallel Execution]
 ├─> Sentiment Guardrail (Safety)
 └─> Intent Classification (Logic)
    ↓
[Decision Node]
    │
    ├─> Human Handoff (Escalation) ✅
    ├─> FAQ Agent (RAG) ✅
    ├─> Booking Agent (Calendar) ✅
    └─> Management Agent (Calendar) ✅
    ↓
[TRT Post-Processing]
 └─> Translate response to Arabic (if needed)
```

### Design Principles
- **1-5 tools per agent** (avoid tool overload)
- **Natural language interface** (no IDs shown to users)
- **Privacy protection** (email addresses never shown to patients)
- **Patient selected at startup** (agent always knows who you are)
- **Auto email notifications** (booking confirmations, cancellations, reschedules)
- **Appointments in Google Calendar only** (not in database)
- **Token cost control** (max_tokens=10000 to manage API costs)

## 📝 Future Phases

- **Phase 4:** Feedback & complaints agent (Canceled)
- ~~**Phase 5:** Auto-create support tickets~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
