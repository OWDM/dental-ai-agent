### What's Built

**Router + FAQ + Booking + Management Agents**
- ✅ **Router** - LLM-based intent classification with conversation memory
- ✅ **FAQ Agent** - RAG-powered Q&A (ChromaDB + Jina embeddings)
- ✅ **Booking Agent** - Google Calendar integration with conflict detection + email notifications
  - Check patient appointments
  - Show available doctors & services from database
  - Create bookings with duplicate prevention
  - Detects both doctor and patient time conflicts
  - Sends confirmation emails automatically
- ✅ **Management Agent** - Appointment management with natural language + email notifications
  - View all upcoming appointments
  - Cancel appointments (by doctor name, service, or date)
  - Reschedule appointments with conflict detection
  - No IDs needed - uses natural references like "my appointment with Dr. Saad"
  - Sends cancellation/reschedule confirmation emails automatically
- ✅ Patient selection at startup (knows who you are throughout conversation)
